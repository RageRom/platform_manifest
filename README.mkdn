Welcome to SlimRoms
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with SlimKat, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using our trees, use this command:

	repo init -u git://github.com/RageRom/platform_manifest.git -b rage

Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync
